# Machine_Learning_Projects
I will be covering all the types of Machine Learning Models under both Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques.
My planned list is as follows:
1) Supervised ML: 
     *) Classification
          a) Support-vector machines
          b) Random forest
          c) Logistic regression
          d) Decision trees
     *) Regression
          e) Linear regression
          f) Regression trees
          g) Non-linear regression
          h) Bayesian liner regression
          g) Polynomial 
  
2) Unsupervised ML:
   a) K-means clustering
   b) K-nearest neighbour
   c) Hierarchal clustering
   d) Anamoly detection
   e) Neural networks
   f) Principle Component Analysis
   g) Independent Component Analysis
   h) Apriori algorithm
   i) Singular value decomposition
